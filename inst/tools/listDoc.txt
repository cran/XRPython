Proxy Class for Python Lists

This class is a proxy for ordinary list objects in Python.  All the
standard Python methods for such objects (e.g., \code{append()}) are
available, but methods for R functions such as \code{]} are not
implemented because Python operators do not behave functionally.

Instead, additional methods are defined for the proxy lists, e.g.,
\code{el(i)}.
